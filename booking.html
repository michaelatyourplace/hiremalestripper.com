        </p>

      <!-- Verification -->
      <div class="mb-5">
        <h3>Verification & Booking Security</h3>
        <p>
          To protect both you and our performers, <strong>all bookings must be verified</strong>. We may require a quick confirmation call, valid address, and deposit via a secure method. This ensures the show goes smoothly and gets scheduled correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Youâ€™ll receive a confirmation email or message with your dancer's name, estimated arrival window, and final details before the show. We believe in full transparencyâ€”what you see is what you get.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Refund Policy -->
      <div class="mb-5">
        <h3>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Life happensâ€”we get it. Thatâ€™s why we offer a <strong>flexible refund policy</strong>. If you cancel more than 72 hours before your scheduled time, youâ€™ll receive a full refund. Cancellations within 72 hours may receive a partial refund or credit toward a future booking, depending on dancer availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          No-shows or last-minute cancellations without notice are non-refundable. If for any reason a dancer must cancel on our end, weâ€™ll offer a replacement or full refund immediately.
